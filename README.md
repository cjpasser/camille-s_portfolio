# [Project 1: Cyclistic Bikeshare Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/camillepasser/cyclistic-bikeshare-3)

* This is my Google Analytics Capstone Project. I used the data from Cyclistic Bikeshare to analyze the difference between casual users and annual members that have subscription to the service.
*  The stakeholders want the user data analyzed to ultimately see the differences between users and how that information can be used to convert casual users into annual paying members.
*  Data source: Kaggle's Cyclistic Bikeshare
*  Tools: R, tidyverse, ggplot2, lubridate, geosphere, gridExtra, ggmap
*  Technologies: RStudio
*  Cleaned and prepared the dataset by removing missing values, outliers, and invalid entries, then performed exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to create new columns for date components, ride duration, distance, and speed.
*  Identified peak usage times for casual users as 5 PM and August as the peak month for both user types. Casual users averaged 45.1 minutes per trip and annual members averaged 15.9 minutes.
* Managed a large dataset with missing values and complex geographical calculations using efficient data handling techniques and precise distance computations.
* Successfully analyzed user behavior to provide insights for converting casual users into annual members, with recommendations for targeted marketing and further analysis.
